A simple mobile cross platform application for tracking general sleepiness and logging sleep sessions.
# Functionality and Design
A simple mobile application for tracking general sleepiness and logging sleep sessions. Developed using Angular and Ionic Framework to accommodate cross platform conventions across iOS and Android. The goal of this project was to get a feel for developing for different mobile platforms while follow the four major principles of good mobile design taught in class:

1. Follow platform conventions
2. A useful initial view
3. Error prevention
4. The “uh-oh” button
